    <h1>Week 7, Day 3 - LAB</h1>
    <h3>Q1: What is a Single Page Application?</h3>
    <p>
        An SPA (Single-page application) is a web app implementation that loads only a single web document, and then updates the body content of that single document via JavaScript APIs such as XMLHttpRequest and Fetch when different content is to be shown.
        <br>
        This therefore allows users to use websites without loading whole new pages from the server, which can result in performance gains and a more dynamic experience, with some tradeoff disadvantages such as SEO, more effort required to maintain state, implement navigation, and do meaningful performance monitoring.

    <h3>Q2: What is REACT?</h3>
    <p>
        A reaction is a physical form of emotion duh... okay but for real
        <br>
        React is a JavaScript-based UI development library, and although it is a library rather than a language, it is widely used in web development. (Or so I've been told)
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Q3: What is JSX?</h3>
    <p>
        Also known as JavaScript XML, it allows us to write HTML in react. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Q4: What is Babel?</h3>
    <p>
        To my knowledge Babel reminds me of the tower of Bable, an Easter Egg in Black Ops 2 Transit. BUT, this isn't that so lets look it up..
        <br>
        Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments.
        <br>
        The more you know!
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Q5: What is Webpack?</h3>
    <p>
        The virtual backpack of course! Its all the rage these days!

        But seriously, webpack is a module bundler. Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Q6: What is Create React App?</h3>
    <p>
        Create React App (CRA) is a tool to create single-page React applications that is officially supported by the React team. The script generates the required files and folders to start the React application and run it on the browser.

        Its also a fun lil executable command in the terminal!($: npx create-react-app)
