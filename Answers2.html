    <h3>Q1: How do you make a Circle in CSS?</h3>

    <p>
        To create a circle, use the border-radius property and set the value to 50%. Then combine the height and width properties with a matching value. Simple! I use it in my react-dashboard file!

    <p>

    <h3>Q4: What is the difference between CSS Grid and Flexbox?</h3>
